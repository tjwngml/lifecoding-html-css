<h1>Existentialism</h1>

<p>
  <strong><u>Existentialism</u></strong> is the philosophy and literary trend of
  the 20th century (the general flow of thought of an era). It is a question of
  "What am I? And what should I do?" and refers to the way of human existence
  that forms self through choice. Humans have no choice but to choose their own
  life as long as they are born, and they are overwhelmed by anxiety about these
  choices and are creating their own future through freedom of choice.
