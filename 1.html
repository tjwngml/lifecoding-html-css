<strong><u>Existentialism</u></strong> is the philosophy and literary trend of
the 20th century (the general flow of thought of an era). It is a question of
"What am I? And what should I do?" and refers to the way of human existence that
forms self through choice. Humans have no choice but to choose their own life as
long as they are born, and they are overwhelmed by anxiety about these choices
and are creating their own future through freedom of choice.
